# JJG-Ansible-Windows

Windows shell provisioning script to bootstrap Ansible from within a Vagrant VM running on Windows.

This script is configured to use configure RHEL-based VM (Fedora, CentOS, etc.) so it can run Ansible playbooks from within the VM through Vagrant.

Read more about this script, and other techniques for using Ansible within a Windows environment, on Server Check.in: [Running Ansible within Windows](https://servercheck.in/blog/running-ansible-within-windows).

## Usage

In your Vagrantfile, use a conditional provisioning statement if you want to use this script (which runs Ansible from within the VM instead of on your hostâ€”this example assumes your playbook and the inventory file are all within a 'provisioning' folder, and this script is within provisioning/JJG-Ansible-Windows):

```ruby
# Use rbconfig to determine if we're on a windows host or not.
require 'rbconfig'
is_windows = (RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os'] =~ /mswin|mingw|cygwin/)
if is_windows
  # Provisioning configuration for shell script.
  config.vm.provision "shell" do |sh|
    sh.path = "provisioning/JJG-Ansible-Windows/windows.sh"
    sh.args = "provisioning/playbook.yml provisioning/inventory"
  end
else
  # Provisioning configuration for Ansible (for Mac/Linux hosts).
  config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "provisioning/playbook.yml"
    ansible.inventory_path = "provisioning/inventory"
    ansible.sudo = true
  end
end
```
